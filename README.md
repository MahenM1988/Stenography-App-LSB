# Image Steganography Script Overview

## Description

This script implements a simple image steganography application that allows users to embed a message within an image and extract it later. It uses the least significant bit (LSB) method for embedding data, combined with AES encryption to secure the message.

## How It Works

1. **Convert Image to Base64**: The `toBase64Image` function takes an image file and converts it to a Base64-encoded string using the FileReader API, returning a promise that resolves with the encoded image.

2. **Generate a Random Key**: The `generateRandomKey` function creates a random hexadecimal key of a specified length (default is 16 bytes) using the `crypto` API for cryptographic strength.

3. **Embedding a Message**:
   - The `embedMessage` function retrieves the selected image and message input from the user.
   - If either is missing, an alert is shown, and the function exits.
   - A random key is generated, and the message is encrypted using AES with the key.
   - The key and the encrypted message are combined and converted to binary format.
   - An image is drawn on a canvas, and the LSB of the pixel data is modified to encode the message bits.
   - Finally, the modified image is downloaded as a new PNG file.

4. **Extracting a Message**:
   - The `extractMessage` function retrieves the uploaded image and converts it to Base64.
   - It draws the image on a canvas and extracts the least significant bits from the pixel data to reconstruct the binary representation of the embedded message.
   - The binary data is then converted back to text, and the message is decrypted using the extracted key.

5. **Binary Conversion**: The functions `textToBinary` and `binaryToText` handle the conversion between text and binary representation, facilitating the encoding and decoding processes.

6. **Image Download**: The `downloadImage` function creates a link element that allows the user to download the modified image as a PNG file.

## Scalability

The application is designed to be scalable:

- **File Format Support**: Additional image formats (e.g., JPEG, BMP) could be supported with minimal changes to the image handling logic.

- **Message Size Limit**: The current implementation can be extended to handle larger messages, potentially by using a more complex encoding scheme or splitting messages across multiple images.

- **Encryption Algorithms**: While AES is used for encryption, other encryption methods could be integrated for enhanced security or user preferences.

- **User Interface Improvements**: The user interface can be enhanced to provide a better user experience, such as progress indicators for longer operations and improved error handling.

- **Mobile Compatibility**: The application can be made mobile-friendly to allow users to upload images and messages from their smartphones or tablets.

- **Batch Processing**: The ability to embed or extract messages from multiple images in a single operation could be added to improve usability.

Overall, this script provides a solid foundation for an image steganography tool, with numerous opportunities for enhancements and additional features in future development.
